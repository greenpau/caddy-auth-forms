implementing Form-Based Authentication and Basic Authentication.

Please ask questions either here or via LinkedIn. I am happy to help you! @greenpau

## Overview

The purpose of this plugin is providing **authentication** only. The plugin
issue JWT tokens upon successful authentication. In turn, the **authorization**
of the tokens is being handled by [`caddy-auth-jwt`](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-jwt).

The plugin supports the following **authentication** backends:

* Local (`local`) - JSON flat file database
* LDAP (`ldap`) - remote Microsoft AD database

Please follow these links for the documentation:

* [Local](./pkg/backends/local/README.md)
* [LDAP](./pkg/backends/ldap/README.md)

The plugin accepts user credentials for **authentication** with:

* Form-based Authentication: `POST` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
* Basic Authentication: `GET` with `Authorization: Basic` header
